This report focuses on developing robust machine learning models for the classification of the mushrooms into edible and poisonous categories. Recognizing the increasing interest in the mushroom foraging and the potential health risks which are associated with the misidentification, timely as well as the accurate classification is quite essential. And more often the primary objective is to design, implement, and evaluate machine learning algorithms capable of predicting the edibility of the mushrooms which are based upon the various features. These features may include cap colour, odour, habitat, and other relevant characteristics. The dataset for the training and testing these models is compiled from diverse sources, such as field observations and documented cases of mushroom toxicity.
