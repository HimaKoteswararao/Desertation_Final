The main goal of this study is to create reliable machine learning models that can distinguish between dangerous and edible mushrooms. Accurate classification and promptness are crucial due to the growing popularity of mushroom foraging and the possible health risks connected with incorrect identification. Primarily, the goal is typically to create, apply, and assess machine learning algorithms that can forecast the mushroom's edible quality by taking into account different characteristics. Cap color, scent, environment, and other pertinent traits are examples of these attributes. A variety of sources, including field observations and confirmed cases of mushroom toxicity, are used to generate the dataset used for training and testing these models.
